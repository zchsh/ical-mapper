# Note on example calendars in ICS format

- The `.ics` files in this directory are generated from `.md` files in `src/example-calendars-md`
- Currently using [zchsh/calendar-from-text-file](https://github.com/zchsh/calendar-from-text-file)
- Doing this for now, since I need some `.ics` data to develop and test with
- Longer term, `.ics` generation should be completely separate from this project
